## Problem 1
### Supersampling (Points 10 + 10 + 10)
A pixel actually corresponds to a square area. Currently you are sampling the pixels only at their center, which lead to aliasing. As you have learned in the lecture, the most simple way for removing aliasing artifacts from your image is _supersampling_, _i.e._ to shoot more than one ray per pixels. The three most frequently used supersampling strategies are:  

**Regular Sampling:** The Pixel is subdivided into _n = m x m_ equally sized regions, which are sampled in the middle:  
_((i+0.5)/m, (j+0.5)/n)_ for _i,j=[0 .. m-1]_

**Random Sampling:** The Pixel is sampled by _n_ randomly placed samples _e<sub>i</sub> in [0; 1)_  
_(e<sub>i,1</sub>,e<sub>i,2</sub>)_ for _i=[0 .. n-1]_

**Stratified Sampling:** Stratified sampling is a combination of regular and random sampling. One sample is randomly placed in each of the _n = m x m_ regions with _e<sub>i,1</sub>,e<sub>i,2</sub> in [0, 1)_  
_((i+e<sub>i</sub>)/m, (j+e<sub>j</sub>)/m)_ for _i,j=[0 .. m-1]_

In this exercise your task is to implement these sampling strategies:
- In the framework you can find an abstract base class ```CSampleGenerator``` with one single virtual method ```void SampleGenerator::GetSamples(int n, float *u, float *v, float *weight)```, which is supposed to works as follows: _n_ is the number of samples to be generated for a pixel. One sample consists of two coordinates (_u_, _v_) that specify a position on a pixel. The _n_ samples generated are then to be returned in the _u_ and _v_ arrays, where (_u_, _v_) should be in the domain _[0 .. 1) X [0 .. 1)_. The weights for the individual samples should sum up to 1, here just use uniform weights with ```weight[i]=1.0f/n```.
- In your main loop, produce _n_ samples, and fire _n_ rays through the pixel at the respective sample position. The resulting color values must be weighted by ```weight[i]``` and summed up, which yields the final pixel result.
- Implement the ```getSamples()``` method in SampleGeneratorRegular.h, SampleGeneratorRandom.h, and SampleGeneratorStratified.h which are derived classes from ```CSampleGenerator```.
Use ground.obj and cb.bmp to render your image with 4 samples and compare them to the following images: (regular) (random) (stratified)

## Problem 5.1 
### Reflection (Points 20)
In contrast to the rasterization algorithms, raytracing can simulate physically correct reflections and refractions. In this assignmnet we will extend the Phong shader to handle both reflections and refractions. 
Proceed as follows:
1. Fork the current repository.
2. Modify the README.md file in your fork and put your name (or names if you work in a group) above.
3. You will find the _torus knot_ model in your data folder.
4. Turn on BSP-support by enabling the flag `ENABLE_BSP` in types.h file or in cmake-gui.exe application.
5. Extend ```CShaderPhong::Shade()``` to also support reflections.
6. Test your implementation with torus knot.obj. 
If everything is correct your images should look like this:  
![](./doc/mirror.jpg) 

## Problem 5.2
### Refraction (Points 30)
Now we need to extend ```CShaderPhong::Shade()``` to also support refractions.
Test your implementation with torus knot.obj and refraction coefficient k = 1.5 (glass) or k = 2.4 (diamond)
If everything is correct your images should look like this:  
![](./doc/glass.jpg) 

## Problem 5.3
### Glass Shading (Points 50)
In order to create the naturally-looking glass matherial, we need to combine reflections and refractions from the previouse problems. Please use the following proportions: 
- Ambient coefficient: 0
- Diffuse reflection coefficient: 0.1
- Specular refelection coefficient: 2
- Shininess exponent: 80
- Perfect reflection (mirror) coefficient: 0.2
- Perfect transmission coefficient: 0.8
- The refractive index of the medium: 1.5

Test your implementation on torus knot.obj. If everything is correct your image should look like this:

## Problem 5.4
### Procedual Bump Mapping (Points 20)
In the last exercise you have learned that the appearence of a surface can be changed by using a modified _surface normal_. In this exercise we will implement a technique called _bump mapping_ which bumps the surface normal sideways such that a surface has the impression of beeing bumped. This often allows to generate the appearance of highly complex surface with only very few primitives. In order to do this, three parameters have to be known for each surface point:
1. The original surface normal _N_.
2. A local coordinate frame for this surface point. Though any coordinate frame can be used (as long as it is consistent), the usual way is to use the surface derivates in _u_ and _v_ direction, called _dPdu_ and _dPdv_.
3. The amount _delta_u_, _delta_v_ of deviation along these tangent vectors. The deviation is usually either read from a texture, or is computed procedurally. The final normal during shading (also for reflections) is then _N' = Normalized(N + delta_u * dPdu + delta_v * dPdv)_.  

In this exercise, you will implement a very basic version of this:
- As surface derivatives, use _dPdu = (1, 0, 0)_ and dPdv = _(0, 0, 1)_.
- For the amount of deviation, use a simple procedural approach, by computing _delta_u = 0.5 * cos(3 * H_x * sin(H_z))_, _delta_v = 0.5 * sin(13 * H_z)_. _H_ denotes the hit point of the ray with the surface.  

For your implementation, proceed as follows:
- Implement the Shade-method in ShaderPhongBumpMapped.h by first copying the ```Shade()```-method from the basic phong shader and then modifying the normal at the beginning of the ```Shade()``` function, following the guidlines given above.
If your shader work correct you should get an image like this using the scene description in main.cpp:  
![bump](./doc/bump_mapping.jpg)

**Tip:** The concept for a local coordinate frame will also be necessary for many other shading concepts, like _e.g._ procedural shading. For the exam, you will probably need such a concept, as the above hardcoded version will not be powerful enough.  
As getting the correct surface derivates can be somewhat complicated, there is also a simpler (though not as powerful) way of getting an orthonormal surface coordinate frame from the surface normal, which is similar to our way of generating the orthonormal camera coordinate frame from the camera direction. For a detailed discussion about surface derivatives you can also read Matt Pharrâ€™s book _Physically Based Rendering_.
